## 💡 Insights & Story

### 1. 🔄 Breaking In Is Hard — But People Do It Anyway

59% of survey respondents switched careers into data from a different field. Yet the majority described breaking in as *"Neither easy nor difficult"* to *"Difficult"*, suggesting determination over smooth entry paths.

### 2. 💸 Salary Satisfaction Is a Pain Point

Salary happiness scored just **4.27 out of 10** — the lowest across all 6 workplace happiness metrics. Despite data roles paying well in absolute terms, professionals feel underpaid relative to expectations.

### 3. 🐍 Python Is King

Python was the favourite programming language for **66.7% of respondents**, dwarfing R (16%) and SQL variants. This signals Python as the non-negotiable skill for anyone entering the data field.

### 4. 🤝 People Like Their Colleagues More Than Their Pay

Coworker happiness (**5.86/10**) and work-life balance (**5.74/10**) scored significantly higher than salary satisfaction (**4.27/10**) — suggesting culture and team dynamic matter more than compensation in day-to-day satisfaction.

### 5. 💼 Better Salary Is the #1 Career Driver

When asked what they'd prioritize in a new job, **47.1% said "Better Salary"** — followed by Remote Work (20.2%) and Work-Life Balance (18.6%).

## 🔄 Data Transformation (Power Query)

The raw survey data required significant cleaning before it could be visualized. Key transformation steps included:

* ✅ Removed irrelevant columns (Browser, OS, Referrer, Email)
* ✅ Standardized free-text job titles into clean role categories
* ✅ Converted salary range strings (e.g. `"41k-65k"`) into numeric midpoint values for averaging
* ✅ Cleaned country names with `"Other (Please Specify):"` prefixes into readable labels
* ✅ Handled null and inconsistent entries across happiness score columns
* ✅ Split and normalized multi-value columns for programming language analysis
